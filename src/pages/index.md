      We are telling the story of the grower and the producers. Capturing the
      story of the product told by the people that make it. Attaching that story
      to the products and allowing people to add to the richness of that story.
      DataHarvest, along with our partners have developed a smart label that
      uniquely pairs blockchain with the food chain. Our open and ground up
      approach provides an important option for those looking to use blockchain
      in their business.
